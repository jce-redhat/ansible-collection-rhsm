# Ansible RHSM Collection

An Ansible collection for doing things with the Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) API.

Currently this content only contains a single role used for downloading products from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads).  See the rhsm\_download role [README](roles/rhsm\_download/README.md) for details on using the role.

Other content related to the RHSM API may be added to this collection in the future.
